                                <p>7.1.1 you are in lawful possession and control of the personal information and that you have the consent of the Data Subject to allow iProERP to process and in any other manner use such personal information for the purpose
                                    for which it was collected or made available and as contemplated in this Privacy Policy;

                                <p>7.1.2 the Data Subject has consented to the Data Subject’s personal information being processed in a country that is different to the Data Subject’s country of residence or business;</p>

                                <p>7.1.3 you will promptly inform iProERP in writing in the event that a Data Subject requests that its personal information be updated or in the event that a Data Subject withdraws the consent referred to in this clause 7.1;</p>

                                    (including legal costs and fees on an indemnity basis) that may be sustained, suffered or secured against or incurred by iProERP arising out of or resulting from:</p>

                                <p>7.2.1 iProERP’s lawful processing of a Data Subject’s personal information;
                                </p>

                                </h5>

                                <p>8.1 The time periods for which iProERP keeps your personal information may vary according to the use or purpose attached to the personal information. iProERP will keep your personal information (i) only for as long as it
                                    is required to fulfil the purpose for which the personal information was collected or for which it is to be processed or (ii) until you withdraw your consent. However, where iProERP is required by applicable law to
                                    retain your personal information longer or where your personal information is required for iProERP to assert or defend against legal claims, iProERP will retain your personal information until the end of the relevant
                                    retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.</p>

                                <p>8.2 At the end of the retention period, iProERP will delete your personal information in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.</p>

                                <h5>9. HOW iProERP SECURES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
                                </h5>

                                <p>9.1 iProERP uses reasonable technical and organisational safeguards that are designed to protect your personal information from unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure,
                                    alteration and destruction.</p>

                                <p>9.2 All transmission of data to and from iProERP’s servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

                                <p>9.3 However, despite iProERP’s efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and iProERP cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that your personal information is acquired, or is reasonably
                                    believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorised person and applicable law requires notification, iProERP will give you notice promptly. iProERP will determine the scope of the breach and investigate and restore the
                                    integrity of the data system.
                                </p>

                                <p>9.4 It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your account password and to your devices.</p>

                                </h5>

                                <p>10.1 iProERP collects and shares information globally.
                                </p>

                                <p>10.2 For purposes of providing the iProERP offerings to you, iProERP may transfer, process and store your personal information outside your country of residence or business to wherever iProERP or its third party service
                                    providers operate. In some of these countries, such as the United States, the privacy protections and rights of authorities to access personal information may not be equivalent to those applicable to your country of
                                    residence or business. However, in such circumstances iProERP requires that any processing of your personal information in such country will be subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
                                </p>

                                <p>11.2 You can exercise some of the above rights by:</p>

                                <p>11.2.1 logging into the iProERP offering and using settings available within the offering or updating your profile settings and modifying content that contains information about you using the options associated with that
                                    content;
                                </p>

                                <p>11.3 iProERP will accommodate your request in terms of clause 11.1 above to the extent that it does not conflict with a statutory obligation or prevailing right of ProERP.</p>

                                <p>11.4 You acknowledge that:</p>

                                <p>11.4.1 any request in terms of clause 11.1 above may mean that you may not be able to continue using some or all of the iProERP offerings;</p>

                                <p>11.4.2 any request in terms of clause 11.1 above will have no effect on iProERP’s past processing of information up until iProERP’s receipt of your request;</p>

                                <p>11.4.3 even though you may opt out of receiving marketing communications, you cannot opt out of, and will continue receiving, transactional communications from iProERP regarding your contracted iProERP offerings.</p>

                                <p>11.5 For natural persons who reside in the European Union, you can request that iProERP restricts its processing of your personal information (i) if you contest the accuracy of the personal information and then for a period
                                    enabling iProERP to verify the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) if there is no legal basis for iProERP to process your personal information and you oppose iProERP’s erasure of such personal information; (iii)
                                    if iProERP no longer needs your personal information for the purposes of processing same but you claim that you require iProERP to retain such information in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against
                                    third party claims; or (iv) if you object to the processing of your personal information, for as long as it is required to review as to whether iProERP has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your
                                    personal information. If you request a copy of your personal information, to the extent that iProERP can comply with such request, it will provide you with that information in a machine-readable form.</p>
