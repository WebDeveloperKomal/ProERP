                                <h5>15. GENERAL CLAUSES
                                </h5>
                                <p>15.1. These Terms shall be deemed to be made under the laws of the Republic of South Africa and the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of these Terms as well as any dispute related to or arising from
                                    these Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Republic of South Africa without regard to the principles of conflict of laws and specifically excluding the provisions of the United Nations Convention
                                    on the International Sale of Goods. You and iProERP hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of South Africa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms precludes iProERP
                                    from taking proceedings against you in any court of competent jurisdiction nor will the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of proceedings in other jurisdictions, whether concurrently
                                    or not.</p>

                                <p>15.2. This Website is controlled and administered by iProERP from its offices within the Republic of South Africa. Access to this Website from territories or countries where the Content of this Website is illegal is prohibited.
                                    You are responsible for compliance with all local laws of the country from which you access this Website.</p>

                                <p>15.3. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between iProERP and you with respect to this Website and your access to and use of this Website and the Content.
                                </p>

                                <p>15.4. In the event that any of the provisions of these Terms are or may become illegal, invalid, unlawful or unenforceable in any jurisdiction affected by these Terms, such provision as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective
                                    to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability and shall be treated as not written in these Terms and severed from the balance of these Terms, without invalidating the remaining provisions of these Terms or affecting
                                    the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
                                </p>

                                <p>15.5. iProERP’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provision or affect in any way iProERP’s right to require the performance of such provision at any time in the future.</p>

                                <p>15.6. You shall not be entitled to cede or assign your rights or delegate your obligations in terms of these Terms to any third party without iProERP’s prior written consent.</p>

                                <p>15.7. No party shall be bound by any express or implied term, representation, warranty, promise or the like not recorded herein.</p>

                                <p>15.8. The head notes to the paragraphs to these Terms are inserted for reference purposes only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions to which they relate.</p>

                                <p>15.9. Words importing the singular shall include the plural and vice versa, and words importing the masculine gender shall include the female and neuter genders and words importing persons shall include partnerships and
                                    corporate and unincorporated entities.</p>

                                <p>15.10. In these Terms “you” is a reference to any juristic entity or individual, including individuals who are registered as users of a juristic entity, who access the Website. You will be responsible for your users’ access
                                    and use of this Website and any breach of these Terms by one of your users will be deemed to be a breach of these Terms by you.</p>

                                <p>15.11. The termination of your relationship with ProERP, for any reason, or the cessation of your use of the Website or the Content shall not affect such of the provisions of these Terms as expressly provide that they will
                                    operate after any such termination or cessation or which of necessity must continue to have effect after such termination or cessation notwithstanding that the provisions themselves do not expressly provide for this.
                                    Such provisions include your obligations relating to iProERP’s Intellectual Property Rights and Confidential Information.</p>

                                <p>15.12. No provision in these Terms shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of iProERP by reason of iProERP having or being deemed to have structured, drafted or introduced such provision.</p>
